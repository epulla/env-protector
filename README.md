- **ü§ê Mask Sensitive Data**: Automatically mask sensitive environment variables when viewing `.env` files. Variable values are replaced with asterisks, allowing you to review the structure of the file without compromising the actual data.

- **‚ûï Add Environment Value Without Opening**: Insert new environment variables directly from the command palette without needing to open the `.env` file. This feature minimizes exposure risks while making it easy to update your environment.
